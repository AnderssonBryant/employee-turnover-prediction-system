# Employee-turnover-prediction-system

## Overview
This project is created based on my thesis for Computer Science degree from Binus University. The project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting probability of employee resignation.

## Features

- Machine Learning Models: Implement a machine learning model to predict employee turnover (yes or no).
- Accuracy Metrics: Evaluate and display the model's accuracy on a test dataset, showcasing its performance.
  
## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is sourced from Kaggle. You can access the dataset using the following link:

[HR Attrition data based on IBM attrition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/singhnproud77/hr-attrition-dataset/data)

## Technologies Used

- Python: The primary programming language for developing the classification model.
- Sklearn: Utilize python library to use machine learning model.
